.SH NAME
rotatelogs \- rotate Apache logs without having to kill the server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rotatelogs
.I logfile
.I rotationtime
.I [offset]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rotatelogs
is a simple program for use in conjunction with Apache's piped logfile
feature, which can be used like this:

.fi
CustomLog "|bin/rotatelogs /var/logs/logfile 86400" common
.mf

This creates the files /var/logs/logfile.nnnn where nnnn is the system
time at which the log nominally starts (this time will always be a multiple of
the rotation time, so you can synchronize cron scripts with it).  At the end
of each rotation time (here after 24 hours) a new log is started.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\fIlogfile\fP
The path plus basename of the logfile.  If \fBlogfile\fP includes any
'%' characters, it is treated as a format string for \fIstrftime(3)\fP.
Otherwise, the suffix .nnnnnnnnnn is automatically added and is the time
in seconds.  Both formats compute the start time from the beginning of the
current period.
.IP \fB\fIrotationtime\fP
The rotation time in seconds.
.IP \fB\fIoffset\fP
The number of minutes offset from UTC.  If omitted, zero is assumed and
UTC is used.  For example, to use local time in the zone UTC -5 hours,
specify a value of \fI-300\fP for this argument.
.SH PORTABILITY
The following logfile format string substitutions should be supported by
all \fIstrftime(3)\fP implementations, see the \fIstrftime(3)\fP man page
for library-specific extensions.
.IP %A
full weekday name (localized)
.IP %a
3-character weekday name (localized)
