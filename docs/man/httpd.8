.SH DESCRIPTION
.B httpd
is the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server program. It is
designed to be run as a standalone daemon process. When used like this
it will create a pool of child processes to handle requests. To stop
it, send a TERM signal to the initial (parent) process. The PID of
this process is written to a file as given in the configuration file.
.PP
This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
of the directives necessary to configure 
.B httpd
see the Apache manual,
which is part of the Apache distribution or can be found at
http://httpd.apache.org/. Paths in this manual may not reflect those
compiled into 
.B httpd.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 12
.BI \-d " serverroot"
Set the initial value for the ServerRoot directive to \fIserverroot\fP. This
can be overridden by the ServerRoot command in the configuration file. The
default is \fB/usr/local/apache2\fP.
.TP
.BI \-f " config"
Execute the commands in the file \fIconfig\fP on startup. If \fIconfig\fP
does not begin with a /, then it is taken to be a path relative to
the ServerRoot. The default is \fBconf/httpd.conf\fP.
.TP
.BI \-C " directive"
Process the configuration \fIdirective\fP before reading config files.
.TP
.BI \-c " directive"
Process the configuration \fIdirective\fP after reading config files.
.TP
.BI \-D " parameter"
Sets a configuration \fIparameter\fP which can be used with
<IfDefine>...</IfDefine> sections in the configuration files
to conditionally skip or process commands.
.TP
.B \-h
Output a short summary of available command line options.
.TP
.B \-l
Output a list of modules compiled into the server.
.TP
.B \-L
Output a list of directives together with expected arguments and
places where the directive is valid.
.TP
.B \-S
Show the settings as parsed from the config file (currently only shows the
virtualhost settings).
.TP
.B \-t
Run syntax tests for configuration files only. The program immediately exits
after these syntax parsing with either a return code of 0 (Syntax OK) or
return code not equal to 0 (Syntax Error).  If 
.BI \-D " DUMP_VHOSTS"
is also set, details of the virtual host configuration will be printed.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version of 
.B httpd
, and then exit.
.TP
.B \-V
Print the version and build parameters of 
.B httpd
, and then exit.
.TP
.B \-X
Run
.B httpd
in debug mode.  Only one worker will be started and the server will not detach
from the console.
