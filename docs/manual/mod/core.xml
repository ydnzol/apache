<usage>

    <p>This directive controls whether requests that contain trailing
    pathname information that follows an actual filename (or
    non-existent file in an existing directory) will be accepted or
    rejected.  The trailing pathname information can be made
    available to scripts in the PATH_INFO environment variable.</p>

    <p>For example, assume the location <code>/test/</code> points to
    a directory that contains only the single file
    <code>here.html</code>.  Then requests for
    <code>/test/here.html/more</code> and
    <code>/test/nothere.html/more</code> both collect
    <code>/more</code> as PATH_INFO.</p>

    <p>The three possible arguments for the
    <directive>AcceptPathInfo</directive> directive are:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt><code>off</code></dt><dd>A request will only be accepted if it
    maps to a literal path that exists.  Therefore a request with
    trailing pathname information after the true filename such as
    <code>/test/here.html/more</code> in the above example will return
    a 404 NOT FOUND error.</dd>

    <dt><code>on</code></dt><dd>A request will be accepted if a
    leading path component maps to a file that exists.  The above
    example <code>/test/here.html/more</code> will be accepted if
    <code>/test/here.html</code> maps to a valid file.</dd>
    
    <dt><code>default</code></dt><dd>The treatment of requests with
    trailing pathname information is determined by the <a
    href="../handler.html">handler</a> responsible for the request.
    The core handler for normal files defaults to rejecting PATH_INFO.
    Handlers that serve scripts, such as <a
    href="mod_cgi.html">cgi-script</a> and <a
    href="mod_isapi.html">isapi-isa</a>, generally accept PATH_INFO by
    default.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The primary purpose of the <code>AcceptPathInfo</code>
    directive is to allow you to override the handler's choice of
    accepting or rejecting PATH_INFO.  This override is required, for
    example, when you use a <a href="../filter.html">filter</a>, such
    as <a href="mod_include.html">INCLUDES</a>, to generate content
    based on PATH_INFO.  The core handler would usually reject the
    request, so you can use the following configuration to enable
    such a script:</p>
<example>
&lt;Files "mypaths.shtml"&gt;<br />
    Options +Includes<br />
    SetOutputFilter INCLUDES<br />
    AcceptPathInfo on<br />
&lt;/Files&gt;

<usage>
    <p>When returning a document to the client the server looks for

    every directory of the path to the document, if distributed
    configuration files are enabled for that directory. For
    example:</p>

<example>
AccessFileName .acl

    <p>before returning the document
    <code>/usr/local/web/index.html</code>, the server will read
    <code>/.acl</code>, <code>/usr/.acl</code>,
    <code>/usr/local/.acl</code> and <code>/usr/local/web/.acl</code>

    <p>This directive specifies the name of the character set that

    character set specified in the body of the document via a
    <code>META</code> tag. A setting of <code>AddDefaultCharset
    Off</code> disables this
    functionality. <code>AddDefaultCharset On</code> enables
    Apache's internal default charset of <code>iso-8859-1</code> as
    required by the directive. You can also specify an alternate
    <em>charset</em> to be used. For example:</p>

<usage>
    <p>When the server finds an .htaccess file (as specified by <directive

    which directives declared in that file can override earlier
    access information.</p>

    <p>When this directive is set to <code>None</code>, then
    .htaccess files are completely ignored. In this case, the
    server will not even attempt to read .htaccess files in the
    filesystem.</p>

    <p>When this directive is set to <code>All</code>, then any
    directive which has the .htaccess <a
    href="directive-dict.html#Context">Context</a> is allowed in
    .htaccess files.</p>

<status>Experimental</status>

<usage>
    <p>This directive enables the generation of
    <code>Content-MD5</code> headers as defined in RFC1864
    respectively RFC2068.</p>

    <p>MD5 is an algorithm for computing a "message digest"
    (sometimes called "fingerprint") of arbitrary-length data, with
    a high degree of confidence that any alterations in the data
    will be reflected in alterations in the message digest.</p>

    <p>The <code>Content-MD5</code> header provides an end-to-end
    message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body. A proxy or
    client may check this header for detecting accidental
    modification of the entity-body in transit. Example header:</p>
<example>
   Content-MD5: AuLb7Dp1rqtRtxz2m9kRpA==
</example>

    <p>Note that this can cause performance problems on your server
    since the message digest is computed on every request (the
    values are not cached).</p>

    <p><code>Content-MD5</code> is only sent for documents served
    by the core, and not by any module. For example, SSI documents,
    output from CGI scripts, and byte range responses do not have
    this header.</p>

<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>

</contextlist>
<override>FileInfo</override>

<usage>
    <p>There will be times when the server is asked to provide a
    document whose type cannot be determined by its MIME types
    mappings.</p>

    <p>The server must inform the client of the content-type of the
    document, so in the event of an unknown type it uses the
    <code>DefaultType</code>. For example:</p>

<example>
      <code>DefaultType image/gif</code>
</example>
    <p>would be appropriate for a directory which contained many gif
    images with filenames missing the .gif extension.</p>

    <p>Note that unlike <directive
    module="core">ForceType</directive>, this directive is only
    provides the default mime-type. All other mime-type definitions,
    including filename extensions, that might identify the media type
    will override this default.</p>

... &lt;/Directory&gt;</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
    <p><directive type="section">Directory</directive> and
    <code>&lt;/Directory&gt;</code> are used to enclose a group of
    directives that will apply only to the named directory and
    sub-directories of that directory. Any directive that is allowed
    in a directory context may be used.  <em>Directory-path</em> is
    either the full path to a directory, or a wild-card string using
    Unix shell-style matching. In a wild-card string, `?' matches any
    single character, and `*' matches any sequences of characters.
    You may also use `[]' character ranges. None of the wildcards
    match a `/' character, so <code>&lt;Directory
    /*/public_html&gt;</code> will not match
    <code>/home/user/public_html</code>, but <code>&lt;Directory
    /home/*/public_html&gt;</code> will match. Example:</p>
<example>
   &lt;Directory /usr/local/httpd/htdocs&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Options Indexes FollowSymLinks<br />
   &lt;/Directory&gt;<br />
</example>

<note>
<p>Be careful with the <em>directory-path</em> arguments: They have
to literally match the filesystem path which Apache uses to access the
files. Directives applied to a particular &lt;Directory&gt; will not
apply to files accessed from that same directory via a different path,
such as via different symbolic links.</p>
</note>

    <p>Extended regular
    expressions can also be used, with the addition of the
    <code>~</code> character. For example:</p>
<example>
   &lt;Directory ~ "^/www/.*/[0-9]{3}"&gt;
</example>
    <p>would match directories in /www/ that consisted of three
    numbers.</p>

    <p>If multiple (non-regular expression) directory sections
    match the directory (or its parents) containing a document,
    then the directives are applied in the order of shortest match
    first, interspersed with the directives from the <a
    href="#accessfilename">.htaccess</a> files. For example,
    with</p>

<example>
      &lt;Directory /&gt;<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;AllowOverride None<br />
       &lt;/Directory&gt;<br />
      <br />
       &lt;Directory /home/&gt;<br />
       &nbsp;&nbsp;AllowOverride FileInfo<br />
       &lt;/Directory&gt;
</example>
    <p>for access to the document <code>/home/web/dir/doc.html</code>
    the steps are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Apply directive <code>AllowOverride None</code>
      (disabling <code>.htaccess</code> files).</li>

      <li>Apply directive <code>AllowOverride FileInfo</code> (for
      directory <code>/home/web</code>).</li>

      <li>Apply any FileInfo directives in
      <code>/home/web/.htaccess</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Regular expressions are not considered until after all of the
    normal sections have been applied. Then all of the regular
    expressions are tested in the order they appeared in the
    configuration file. For example, with</p>

<example>&lt;Directory ~ abc$&gt;<br />
       ... directives here ...<br />
       &lt;/Directory&gt;<br />
</example>

    <p>The regular expression section won't be considered until after
    all normal &lt;Directory&gt;s and <code>.htaccess</code> files
    have been applied. Then the regular expression will match on
    <code>/home/abc/public_html/abc</code> and be applied.</p>

   <p><strong>Note that the default Apache access for
    &lt;Directory /&gt; is <code>Allow from All</code>. This means
    that Apache will serve any file mapped from an URL. It is
    recommended that you change this with a block such
    as</strong></p>

<example>
 &lt;Directory /&gt;<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;Order Deny,Allow<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;Deny from All<br />
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
</example>

    <p><strong>and then override this for directories you
    <em>want</em> accessible. See the <a
    href="../misc/security_tips.html">Security Tips</a> page for more
    details.</strong></p> 

    <p>The directory sections typically occur in
    the access.conf file, but they may appear in any configuration
    file.  <directive type="section">Directory</directive> directives

<usage>
    <p>This directive controls whether the httpd may use
    memory-mapping if it needs to read the contents of a file during
    delivery.  By default, when the handling of a request requires
    access to the data within a file-- for example, when delivering a
    server-parsed file using <module>mod_include</module>-- Apache
    memory-maps the file if the OS supports it.
    </p>
    <p>
    This memory-mapping sometimes yields a performance improvement.
    But in some environments, it is better to disable the memory-mapping
    to prevent operational problems:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>On some multiprocessor systems, memory-mapping can reduce the
    performance of the httpd.</li>
    <li>With an NFS-mounted <directive module="core">DocumentRoot</directive>,
    the httpd may crash due tof a segmentation fault if a file is deleted
    or truncated while the httpd has it memory-mapped.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    For server configurations that are vulnerable to these problems,
    you should disable memory-mapping of delivered files by specifying:
    </p>

   EnableMMAP off

<compatibility>Quoting syntax for text messages is different in Apache

<usage>
    <p>In the event of a problem or error, Apache can be configured
    to do one of four things,</p>

    <ol>
      <li>output a simple hardcoded error message</li>

      <li>output a customized message</li>

      <li>redirect to a local <em>URL-path</em> to handle the
      problem/error</li>

      <li>redirect to an external <em>URL</em> to handle the
      problem/error</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first option is the default, while options 2-4 are
    configured using the <directive>ErrorDocument</directive>
    directive, which is followed by the HTTP response code and a URL
    or a message. Apache will sometimes offer additional information
    regarding the problem/error.</p>

    <p>URLs can begin with a slash (/) for local URLs, or be a full
    URL which the client can resolve. Alternatively, a message can
    be provided to be displayed by the browser. Examples:</p>

<example>
      ErrorDocument 500
      http://foo.example.com/cgi-bin/tester<br />
       ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/bad_urls.pl<br />
       ErrorDocument 401 /subscription_info.html<br />
       ErrorDocument 403 "Sorry can't allow you access
      today"

    <p>Note that when you specify an <directive>ErrorDocument</directive>
    that points to a remote URL (ie. anything with a method such as
    "http" in front of it), Apache will send a redirect to the
    client to tell it where to find the document, even if the
    document ends up being on the same server. This has several
    implications, the most important being that the client will not
    receive the original error status code, but instead will
    receive a redirect status code. This in turn can confuse web
    robots and other clients which try to determine if a URL is
    valid using the status code. In addition, if you use a remote
    URL in an <code>ErrorDocument 401</code>, the client will not
    know to prompt the user for a password since it will not
    receive the 401 status code. Therefore, <strong>if you use an
    "ErrorDocument 401" directive then it must refer to a local
    document.</strong></p>

    <p>Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) will ignore server-generated
    error messages when they are "too small" and substitute its own
    "friendly" error messages.  The size threshold varies depending on
    the type of error, but in general, if you make your error document
    greater than 512 bytes, then MSIE will show the server-generated
    error rather than masking it.  More information is available in

<usage>
    <p>
    The <directive>FileETag</directive> directive configures the file
    attributes that are used to create the ETag (entity tag) response
    header field when the document is based on a file.  (The ETag
    value is used in cache management to save network bandwidth.)  In
    Apache 1.3.22 and earlier, the ETag value was <em>always</em> formed
    from the file's inode, size, and last-modified time (mtime).  The
    FileETag directive allows you to choose which of these -- if any
    -- should be used.  The recognized keywords are:
    </p>
    <dl>
     <dt><strong>INode</strong></dt>
     <dd>The file's i-node number will be included in the calculation</dd>
     <dt><strong>MTime</strong></dt>
     <dd>The date and time the file was last modified will be included</dd>
     <dt><strong>Size</strong></dt>
     <dd>The number of bytes in the file will be included</dd>
     <dt><strong>All</strong></dt>
     <dd>All available fields will be used (equivalent to
      '<code>FileETag&nbsp;INode&nbsp;MTime&nbsp;Size</code>')</dd>
     <dt><strong>None</strong></dt>
     <dd>If a document is file-based, no ETag field will be included in the
      response</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
    The INode, MTime, and Size keywords may be prefixed with either '+'
    or '-', which allow changes to be made to the default setting
    inherited from a broader scope.  Any keyword appearing without
    such a prefix immediately and completely cancels the inherited
    setting.
    </p>
    <p>
    If a directory's configuration includes
    '<code>FileETag&nbsp;INode&nbsp;MTime&nbsp;Size</code>', and a
    subdirectory's includes '<code>FileETag&nbsp;-INode</code>',
    the setting for that subdirectory (which will be inherited by
    any sub-subdirectories that don't override it) will be equivalent to
    '<code>FileETag&nbsp;MTime&nbsp;Size</code>'.

    <p>The <directive type="section">Files</directive> directive

    matched with a <code>&lt;/Files&gt;</code> directive. The
    directives given within this section will be applied to any object
    with a basename (not a full path) matching the
    specified filename. <directive type="section">Files</directive>
    sections are processed in the order they appear in the

    type="section">Directory</directive> sections and
    <code>.htaccess</code> files are read, but before <directive

    that <directive type="section">Files</directive> can be nested
    inside <directive type="section"
    module="core">Directory</directive> sections to restrict the
    portion of the filesystem they apply to.</p>

    <p>The <em>filename</em> argument should include a filename, or
    a wild-card string, where `?' matches any single character, and
    `*' matches any sequences of characters. Extended regular
    expressions can also be used, with the addition of the
    <code>~</code> character. For example:</p>
<example>
   &lt;Files ~ "\.(gif|jpe?g|png)$"&gt;
</example>
    <p>would match most common Internet graphics formats. In Apache 1.3
    and later, <directive module="core"

<syntax>HostnameLookups on|off|double</syntax>
<default>HostnameLookups off</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context></contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>This directive enables DNS lookups so that host names can be
    logged (and passed to CGIs/SSIs in <code>REMOTE_HOST</code>).
    The value <code>double</code> refers to doing double-reverse
    DNS. That is, after a reverse lookup is performed, a forward
    lookup is then performed on that result. At least one of the ip
    addresses in the forward lookup must match the original
    address. (In "tcpwrappers" terminology this is called
    <code>PARANOID</code>.)</p>

    <p>Regardless of the setting, when <module>mod_access</module> is
    used for controlling access by hostname, a double reverse lookup
    will be performed.  This is necessary for security. Note that the
    result of this double-reverse isn't generally available unless you
    set <code>HostnameLookups double</code>. For example, if only
    <code>HostnameLookups on</code> and a request is made to an object
    that is protected by hostname restrictions, regardless of whether
    the double-reverse fails or not, CGIs will still be passed the
    single-reverse result in <code>REMOTE_HOST</code>.</p>

    <p>The default is off in order to save the network
    traffic for those sites that don't truly need the reverse
    lookups done. It is also better for the end users because they
    don't have to suffer the extra latency that a lookup entails.
    Heavily loaded sites should leave this directive
    <code>off</code>, since DNS lookups can take considerable
    amounts of time. The utility <a
    href="../programs/logresolve.html">logresolve</a>, provided in
    the <em>/support</em> directory, can be used to look up host
    names from logged IP addresses offline.</p>

<usage>
    <p>This directive enables RFC1413-compliant logging of the
    remote user name for each connection, where the client machine
    runs identd or something similar. This information is logged in
    the access log.</p>

    <p>The information should not be trusted in any way except for
    rudimentary usage tracking.</p>

    <p>Note that this can cause serious latency problems accessing
    your server since every request requires one of these lookups
    to be performed. When firewalls are involved each lookup might
    possibly fail and add 30 seconds of latency to each hit. So in
    general this is not very useful on public servers accessible
    from the Internet.</p>

<usage>
    <p>The <code>&lt;IfDefine

    processed if the <em>test</em> is true. If <em>test</em> is false,
    everything between the start and end markers is ignored.</p>

    <p>The <em>test</em> in the <directive

    of two forms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>parameter-name</em></li>

    <p>In the former case, the directives between the start and end

    the test, and only processes the directives if

    <p>The <em>parameter-name</em> argument is a define as given on
    the <code>httpd</code> command line via
    <code>-D</code><em>parameter-</em>, at the time the server was

    <p><directive type="section">IfDefine</directive> sections are

    <p>The <code>&lt;IfModule

    <directive type="section">IfModule</directive> section are only
    processed if the <em>test</em> is true. If <em>test</em> is false,
    everything between the start and end markers is ignored.</p>

    <p>The <em>test</em> in the <directive

    of two forms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>module name</em></li>

      <li>!<em>module name</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the former case, the directives between the start and end

    dynamically loaded using <directive module="mod_so"
    >LoadModule</directive>. The second format
    reverses the test, and only processes the directives if <em>module

    <p>The <em>module name</em> argument is the file name of the
    module, at the time it was compiled.  For example,
    <code>mod_rewrite.c</code>.  If a module consists of several

<usage>
    <p>This directive allows inclusion of other configuration files

    <p>If <directive>Include</directive> points to a directory, rather than a

    starting with a slash), or may be relative to the 
    <directive module="core">ServerRoot</directive> directory.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>

<example>
     Include /usr/local/apache/conf/ssl.conf<br />
     Include /usr/local/apache/conf/vhosts/
</example>

     <p>Or, providing paths relative to your <code>ServerRoot</code>
     directory:</p>

<example>
     Include conf/ssl.conf<br />
     Include conf/vhosts/
</example>

     <p>Make sure that an included directory does not contain any stray
     files, such as editor temporary files, for example, as Apache will
     attempt to read them in and use the contents as configuration
     directives, which may cause the server to fail on start up.
     Running <code>apachectl configtest</code> will give you a list of
     the files that are being processed during the configuration
     check:</p>

<example><pre>
 root@host# apachectl configtest
  Processing config directory: /usr/local/apache/conf/vhosts
  Processing config file: /usr/local/apache/conf/vhosts/vhost1
  Processing config file: /usr/local/apache/conf/vhosts/vhost2

<usage>
    <p>The Keep-Alive extension to HTTP/1.0 and the persistent
    connection feature of HTTP/1.1 provide long-lived HTTP sessions
    which allow multiple requests to be sent over the same TCP
    connection. In some cases this has been shown to result in an
    almost 50% speedup in latency times for HTML documents with
    many images. To enable Keep-Alive connections in Apache 1.2 and
    later, set <code>KeepAlive On</code>.</p>

    <p>For HTTP/1.0 clients, Keep-Alive connections will only be
    used if they are specifically requested by a client. In
    addition, a Keep-Alive connection with an HTTP/1.0 client can
    only be used when the length of the content is known in
    advance. This implies that dynamic content such as CGI output,
    SSI pages, and server-generated directory listings will
    generally not use Keep-Alive connections to HTTP/1.0 clients.
    For HTTP/1.1 clients, persistent connections are the default
    unless otherwise specified. If the client requests it, chunked
    encoding will be used in order to send content of unknown
    length over persistent connections.</p>

    the resource and the methods allowed on that resource. CGI scripts
    typically use the message body for passing form information to the
    server. Implementations of the PUT method will require a value at
    least as large as any representation that the server wishes to
    accept for that resource.</p>

    <p>This directive gives the server administrator greater
    control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
    useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service
    attacks.</p>

    <p>If, for example, you are permitting file upload to a particular
    location, and wich to limit the size of the uploaded file to 100K,
    you might use the following directive:</p>

<syntax>LimitRequestFields <em>number</em></syntax>
<default>LimitRequestFields 100</default>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
    <p><em>Number</em> is an integer from 0 (meaning unlimited) to
    32767. The default value is defined by the compile-time
    constant <code>DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_FIELDS</code> (100 as
    distributed).</p>

    <p>The <directive>LimitRequestFields</directive> directive allows
    the server administrator to modify the limit on the number of
    request header fields allowed in an HTTP request. A server needs
    this value to be larger than the number of fields that a normal
    client request might include. The number of request header fields
    used by a client rarely exceeds 20, but this may vary among
    different client implementations, often depending upon the extent
    to which a user has configured their browser to support detailed
    content negotiation. Optional HTTP extensions are often expressed
    using request header fields.</p>

    <p>This directive gives the server administrator greater
    control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be
    useful for avoiding some forms of denial-of-service attacks.
    The value should be increased if normal clients see an error
    response from the server that indicates too many fields were
    sent in the request.</p>

    <example>
    LimitRequestFields 50

<syntax>LimitRequestFieldsize <em>bytes</em></syntax>

<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>This directive specifies the number of <em>bytes</em> from 0
    to the value of the compile-time constant
    <code>DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_FIELDSIZE</code> (8190 as
    distributed) that will be allowed in an HTTP request
    header.</p>

    <p>The <directive>LimitRequestFieldsize</directive> directive
    allows the server administrator to reduce the limit on the allowed
    size of an HTTP request header field below the normal input buffer
    size compiled with the server. A server needs this value to be
    large enough to hold any one header field from a normal client
    request. The size of a normal request header field will vary
    greatly among different client implementations, often depending
    upon the extent to which a user has configured their browser to
    support detailed content negotiation.</p>

    <p>This directive gives the server administrator greater
    control over abnormal client request behavior, which may be

    <p>For example:</p>

<usage>
    <p>This directive sets the number of <em>bytes</em> from 0 to
    the value of the compile-time constant
    <code>DEFAULT_LIMIT_REQUEST_LINE</code> (8190 as distributed)
    that will be allowed on the HTTP request-line.</p>

    <p>The <directive>LimitRequestLine</directive> directive allows
    the server administrator to reduce the limit on the allowed size
    of a client's HTTP request-line below the normal input buffer size
    compiled with the server. Since the request-line consists of the
    HTTP method, URI, and protocol version, the
    <directive>LimitRequestLine</directive> directive places a
    restriction on the length of a request-URI allowed for a request
    on the server. A server needs this value to be large enough to
    hold any of its resource names, including any information that
    might be passed in the query part of a GET request.</p>

    <p>This directive gives the server administrator greater

<syntax>&lt;Location
    URL-path|URL&gt; ... &lt;/Location&gt;</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
</contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive type="section">Location</directive> directive
    provides for access control by URL. It is similar to the
    <directive type="section" module="core">Directory</directive>
    directive, and starts a subsection which is terminated with a
    <code>&lt;/Location&gt;</code> directive. <directive
    type="section">Location</directive> sections are processed in the
    order they appear in the configuration file, after the <directive
    type="section" module="core">Directory</directive> sections and
    <code>.htaccess</code> files are read, and after the <directive
    type="section" module="core">Files</directive> sections.</p>

    <p>Note that URLs do not have to line up with the filesystem at
    all, it should be emphasized that &lt;Location&gt; operates
    completely outside the filesystem.</p>

    <p>For all origin (non-proxy) requests, the URL to be matched is a
    URL-path of the form <code>/path/</code>.  No scheme, hostname,
    port, or query string may be included.  For proxy requests, the
    URL to be matched is of the form
    <code>scheme://servername/path</code>, and you must include the
    prefix.</p>

    <p>The URL may use wildcards In a wild-card string, `?' matches
    any single character, and `*' matches any sequences of
    characters.</p>

    <p>Extended regular
    expressions can also be used, with the addition of the
    <code>~</code> character. For example:</p>
<example>
   &lt;Location ~ "/(extra|special)/data"&gt;
</example>

    <p>would match URLs that contained the substring "/extra/data" or
    "/special/data". In Apache 1.3 and above, a new directive
    <directive type="section" module="core">LocationMatch</directive>
    exists which behaves identical to the regex version of
    <directive type="section">Location</directive>.</p>

    <p>The <directive type="section">Location</directive>
    functionality is especially useful when combined with the
    <directive module="core">SetHandler</directive>
    directive. For example, to enable status requests, but allow them
    only from browsers at foo.com, you might use:</p>
<example>
    &lt;Location /status&gt;<br />
    SetHandler server-status<br />
    Order Deny,Allow<br />
    Deny from all<br />
    Allow from .foo.com<br />
    &lt;/Location&gt;
</example>

<note><title>Note about / (slash)</title> <p>The slash character has
special meaning depending on where in a URL it appears. People may be
used to its behavior in the filesystem where multiple adjacent slashes
are frequently collapsed to a single slash (<em>i.e.</em>,
<code>/home///foo</code> is the same as <code>/home/foo</code>). In
URL-space this is not necessarily true. The <directive type="section"
module="core">LocationMatch</directive> directive and the regex
version of <directive type="section">Location</directive> require you
to explicitly specify multiple slashes if that is your intention.  For
example, <code>&lt;LocationMatch ^/abc&gt;</code> would match the
request URL <code>/abc</code> but not the request URL
<code>//abc</code>. The (non-regex) <directive
type="section">Location</directive> directive behaves similarly when
used for proxy requests. But when (non-regex) <directive
type="section">Location</directive> is used for non-proxy requests it
will implicitly match multiple slashes with a single slash. For
example, if you specify <code>&lt;Location /abc/def&gt;</code> and the
request is to <code>/abc//def</code> then it will match.</p>

<syntax>NameVirtualHost <em>addr</em>[:<em>port</em>]</syntax>
<contextlist><context>server config</context></contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>NameVirtualHost</directive> directive is a
    required directive if you want to configure <a
    href="../vhosts/">name-based virtual hosts</a>.</p>

    <p>Although <em>addr</em> can be hostname it is recommended
    that you always use an IP address, <em>e.g.</em></p>

<example>NameVirtualHost 111.22.33.44</example>

    <p>With the <directive>NameVirtualHost</directive> directive you
    specify the IP address on which the server will receive requests
    for the name-based virtual hosts. This will usually be the address
    to which your name-based virtual host names resolve. In cases
    where a firewall or other proxy receives the requests and forwards
    them on a different IP address to the server, you must specify the
    IP address of the physical interface on the machine which will be
    servicing the requests. If you have multiple name-based hosts on
    multiple addresses, repeat the directive for each address.</p>

    <p>Note: the "main server" and any _default_ servers will
    <strong>never</strong> be served for a request to a
    <directive>NameVirtualHost</directive> IP Address (unless for some
    reason you specify <directive>NameVirtualHost</directive> but then
    don't define any VirtualHosts for that address).</p>

    <p>Optionally you can specify a port number on which the
    name-based virtual hosts should be used, <em>e.g.</em></p>

<example>NameVirtualHost 111.22.33.44:8080</example>

     <p>IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets, as shown
     in the following example:</p>
 
<example>NameVirtualHost [fe80::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea]:8080</example>

    <p>To receive requests on all interfaces, you can use an argument of
    *</p>

<example>NameVirtualHost *</example>

<note><title>Argument to &lt;VirtualHost&gt; directive</title>
<p>Note that the argument to the &lt;VirtualHost&gt; directive must exactly
match the argument to the <directive>NameVirtualHost</directive>
directive.</p>

NameVirtualHost 1.2.3.4<br />
&lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4&gt;<br />

      against <directive type="section"
      module="core">Directory</directive> sections.<br />
      <strong>Note</strong>: this option gets ignored if set inside a
      <directive type="section" module="core">Location</directive>
      section.</dd>

      <dt>Includes</dt>

      <dd>
      Server-side includes are permitted.</dd>

      <dt>IncludesNOEXEC</dt>

      <dd>

      Server-side includes are permitted, but the #exec command and
      #exec CGI are disabled. It is still possible to #include
      virtual CGI scripts from ScriptAliase'd directories.</dd>

      <dt>Indexes</dt>

      <dd>
      If a URL which maps to a directory is requested, and the
      there is no DirectoryIndex (<em>e.g.</em>, index.html) in
      that directory, then the server will return a formatted
      listing of the directory.</dd>

      <dt>MultiViews</dt>

      <dd>
      <a href="../content-negotiation.html">Content negotiated</a>
      MultiViews are allowed.</dd>

      <dt>SymLinksIfOwnerMatch</dt>

      <dd>

      The server will only follow symbolic links for which the target
      file or directory is owned by the same user id as the link.<br
      /> <strong>Note</strong>: this option gets ignored if set inside
      a <directive module="core" type="section">Location</directive>
      section.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Normally, if multiple <directive>Options</directive> could apply to a
    directory, then the most specific one is taken complete; the
    options are not merged. However if <em>all</em> the options on
    the <directive>Options</directive> directive are preceded by a + or -
    symbol, the options are merged. Any options preceded by a + are
    added to the options currently in force, and any options
    preceded by a - are removed from the options currently in
    force. </p>

    <p>For example, without any + and - symbols:</p>


<example>&lt;Directory /web/docs&gt;<br />
       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks<br />
       &lt;/Directory&gt;<br />
       &lt;Directory /web/docs/spec&gt;<br />
       Options Includes<br />
       &lt;/Directory&gt;
</example>
    <p>then only <code>Includes</code> will be set for the
    /web/docs/spec directory. However if the second
    <directive>Options</directive> directive uses the + and - symbols:</p> 

<example>
      &lt;Directory /web/docs&gt;<br />
       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks<br />
       &lt;/Directory&gt;<br />
       &lt;Directory /web/docs/spec&gt;<br />
       Options +Includes -Indexes<br />
       &lt;/Directory&gt;
</example>
    <p>then the options <code>FollowSymLinks</code> and
    <code>Includes</code> are set for the /web/docs/spec directory.</p>
    

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using <code>-IncludesNOEXEC</code> or
    <code>-Includes</code> disables server-side includes completely
    regardless of the previous setting.</p>

    <p>The default in the absence of any other settings is
    <code>All</code>.</p>

<compatibility>In version 2.0, this
     directive supersedes the functionality of the <directive>Port</directive>
     directive from version 1.3.</compatibility>

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>ServerName</directive> directive sets the hostname and
    port that the server uses to identify itself.  This is used when
    creating redirection URLs.  For example, if the name of the
    machine hosting the webserver is <code>simple.example.com</code>,
    but the machine also has the DNS alias <code>www.example.com</code>
    and you wish the webserver to be so identified, the following
    directive should be used:</p>

<example>ServerName www.example.com:80</example>

    <p>If no <directive>ServerName</directive> is specified, then the
    server attempts to deduce the hostname by performing a reverse
    lookup on the IP address.  If no port is specified in the
    servername, then the server will use the port from the incoming
    request.  For optimal reliability and predictability, you should
    specify an explicit hostname and port using the
    <directive>ServerName</directive> directive.</p>

    <p>If you are using <a
    href="../vhosts/name-based.html">name-based virtual hosts</a>,
    the <directive>ServerName</directive> inside a
    <directive type="section" module="core">VirtualHost</directive>
    section specifies what hostname must appear in the request's
    <code>Host:</code> header to match this virtual host.</p>

    <p>See the description of the
    <directive module="core">UseCanonicalName</directive> directive for
    settings which determine whether self-referential URL's (e.g., by the
    <module>mod_dir</module> module) will refer to the
    specified port, or to the port number given in the client's request.

<usage>
    <p>The <directive>ServerSignature</directive> directive allows the
    configuration of a trailing footer line under server-generated
    documents (error messages, mod_proxy ftp directory listings,
    mod_info output, ...). The reason why you would want to enable
    such a footer line is that in a chain of proxies, the user often
    has no possibility to tell which of the chained servers actually
    produced a returned error message.<br /> The <code>Off</code>
    setting, which is the default, suppresses the error line (and is
    therefore compatible with the behavior of Apache-1.2 and
    below). The <code>On</code> setting simply adds a line with the
    server version number and <directive
    module="core">ServerName</directive> of the serving virtual host,
    and the <code>EMail</code> setting additionally creates a
    "mailto:" reference to the <directive

    <p>The <directive>TimeOut</directive> directive currently defines

<contextlist><context>server config</context><context>virtual host</context>
<context>directory</context></contextlist>

<usage>
    <p>In many situations Apache must construct a
    <em>self-referential</em> URL -- that is, a URL that refers back to
    the same server. With <code>UseCanonicalName on</code> Apache will
    use the hostname and port specified in the <directive
    module="core">ServerName</directive> directive to construct the canonical
    name for the server. This name is used in all self-referential
    URLs, and for the values of <code>SERVER_NAME</code> and
    <code>SERVER_PORT</code> in CGIs.</p>

    <p>With <code>UseCanonicalName off</code> Apache will form
    self-referential URLs using the hostname and port supplied by
    the client if any are supplied (otherwise it will use the
    canonical name, as defined above). These values are the same
    that are used to implement <a 
    href="../vhosts/name-based.html">name based virtual hosts</a>,
    and are available with the same clients. The CGI variables 
    <code>SERVER_NAME</code> and <code>SERVER_PORT</code> will be
    constructed from the client supplied values as well.</p>

    <p>An example where this may be useful is on an intranet server
    where you have users connecting to the machine using short
    names such as <code>www</code>. You'll notice that if the users
    type a shortname, and a URL which is a directory, such as
    <code>http://www/splat</code>, <em>without the trailing
    slash</em> then Apache will redirect them to
    <code>http://www.domain.com/splat/</code>. If you have
    authentication enabled, this will cause the user to have to
    authenticate twice (once for <code>www</code> and once again
    for <code>www.domain.com</code> -- see <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#prompted-twice">the
    FAQ on this subject for more information</a>). But if
    <directive>UseCanonicalName</directive> is set off, then Apache will
    redirect to <code>http://www/splat/</code>.</p>

    <p>There is a third option, <code>UseCanonicalName DNS</code>,
    which is intended for use with mass IP-based virtual hosting to
    support ancient clients that do not provide a
    <code>Host:</code> header. With this option Apache does a
    reverse DNS lookup on the server IP address that the client
    connected to in order to work out self-referential URLs.</p>

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> if CGIs make assumptions about the
    values of <code>SERVER_NAME</code> they may be broken by this
    option. The client is essentially free to give whatever value
    they want as a hostname. But if the CGI is only using
    <code>SERVER_NAME</code> to construct self-referential URLs
    then it should be just fine.</p>

<usage>
    <p><directive type="section">VirtualHost</directive> and
    <code>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code> are used to enclose a group of
    directives that will apply only to a particular virtual host. Any
    directive that is allowed in a virtual host context may be
    used. When the server receives a request for a document on a
    particular virtual host, it uses the configuration directives
    enclosed in the <directive type="section">VirtualHost</directive>
    section. <em>Addr</em> can be</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The IP address of the virtual host;</li>

      <li>A fully qualified domain name for the IP address of the
      virtual host;</li>

      <li>The character *, which is used only in combination with
      <code>NameVirtualHost *</code> to match all IP addresses; or</li>

      <li>The string <code>_default_</code>, which is used only
      with IP virtual hosting to catch unmatched IP addresses.</li>
    </ul>
    

<example><title>Example</title>
       &lt;VirtualHost 10.1.2.3&gt;<br />
       ServerAdmin webmaster@host.foo.com<br />
       DocumentRoot /www/docs/host.foo.com<br />
       ServerName host.foo.com<br />
       ErrorLog logs/host.foo.com-error_log<br />
       TransferLog logs/host.foo.com-access_log<br />
       &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</example>

 
     <p>IPv6 addresses must be specified in square brackets because
     the optional port number could not be determined otherwise.  An
     IPv6 example is shown below:</p>

<example>     
&lt;VirtualHost [fe80::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea]&gt;<br />
        ServerAdmin webmaster@host.foo.com<br />
        DocumentRoot /www/docs/host.foo.com<br />
        ServerName host.foo.com<br />
       ErrorLog logs/host.foo.com-error_log<br />
        TransferLog logs/host.foo.com-access_log<br />
        &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</example>  

    <p>Each Virtual Host must correspond to a different IP address,
    different port number or a different host name for the server,
    in the former case the server machine must be configured to
    accept IP packets for multiple addresses. (If the machine does
    not have multiple network interfaces, then this can be
    accomplished with the <code>ifconfig alias</code> command (if
    your OS supports it).</p>

    <p>When using IP-based virtual hosting, the special name
    <code>_default_</code> can be specified in
    which case this virtual host will match any IP address that is
    not explicitly listed in another virtual host. In the absence
    of any _default_ virtual host the "main" server config,
    consisting of all those definitions outside any VirtualHost
    section, is used when no IP-match occurs.  (But note that any IP
    address that matches a <directive
    module="core">NameVirtualHost</directive> directive will use neither
    the "main" server config nor the _default_ virtual host.  See the <a
    href="../vhosts/name-based.html">name-based virtual hosting</a>
    documentation for further details.)</p>

    <p>You can specify a <code>:port</code> to change the port that is
    matched. If unspecified then it defaults to the same port as the
    most recent <directive module="mpm_common">Listen</directive>
    statement of the main server. You may also specify <code>:*</code>
    to match all ports on that address. (This is recommended when used
    with <code>_default_</code>.)</p>

    <p><strong>SECURITY</strong>: See the <a
    href="../misc/security_tips.html">security tips</a> document
    for details on why your security could be compromised if the
    directory where logfiles are stored is writable by anyone other
